1.)	The system shall generate a random integer N such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10 at the start of each new game.
2.)	The player shall be allowed a maximum of 5 counted guesses per game.
3.)	After each counted guess, the system shall display whether the guess is “too high,” “too low,” or “correct.”
4.)	The system shall validate that each input is a whole number; if not, it shall display an error message and shall not count the input as a guess.
5.)	After each counted guess, the system shall display the number of remaining guesses.
6.) If the player guesses N correctly, the game shall end immediately and display a win message.
7.)	If the player reaches 5 counted guesses without guessing N, the system shall display the correct number and a loss message, then end the game.
8.) After the game ends (win or loss), the system shall prompt the player to restart using Y/N input; if Y, the system shall start a new game and generate a new N.
9.)	The system shall reject any guess that is outside 1–10 or repeats a previous counted guess within the same game by displaying an error message and not counting that input as a guess.
10.) The system shall maintain and display a session record of wins and losses that persists until the program is closed.
