handle file input 
	this can be any type of file. because you are converting the entire file to a string
	png, docx, txt

read the entire file

convert it to a string 
	converting the ENTIRE file to a string

assign/copy the string to a reverse order variable
	using this to fulfill the requirement of printing the string in reverse order later 

flip/reverse that reverseOrder string variable to prepare it to print at the program finish
	keeping this stored to print later

then sort the original string from lowest to highest values
	this will allow us to later count the number of occurences for each characters

check how many of each characters show up in the string
	count the occurences of each value

assign the top 3 occurences to a individual variables
	we can use these to later print the top 3 character occurences

get all extended ascii characters that are not detected
	any value that is missing from being read should be prepared to be printed later

print the top 3 character occurences to user
	formatted by rank of most occuring and least occuring

print all of those characters that are not detected to user 
	any characters that were not in the string of entire file

finally print out the reverseOrder string variable to user
	print the prior stored variable of the reverseOrder string

produce a really good design
	can optionally submit a code implementation
