Requirements:

The player can move the ship left/right (optionally up/down) using keyboard controls.
The game scrolls forward continuously to simulate motion through the tunnel.
Obstacles spawn ahead of the player and travel toward the player at the scroll speed.
If the ship collides with an obstacle, the player loses a life (or the game ends if using 1-life mode).
The score increases over time based on survival duration and/or distance traveled.
Collectible items spawn periodically and add points when collected.
The game difficulty increases over time by increasing scroll speed and/or obstacle spawn rate.
A start screen is shown with a “Press key to start” prompt.
A game over screen shows the final score and a restart option.
The current score (and lives if applicable) is displayed on screen during gameplay.
